# Snowfall WordPress Plugin

A WordPress plugin that makes it snow on every page of the website

This plugin uses jQuery to create and animate the snowflakes. If you want to customize the appearance and behavior of the snowfall, you can adjust the parameters in the JavaScript code.

If you are on a local server, move the folder inside the wp-content/plugins directory. 
Go to your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to the Plugins section, find the "Snowfall Plugin", and activate it.

Now, your website should display a snowfall effect on every page.
